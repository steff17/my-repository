- PSP and TSP are good tools to introduce discipline concepts and software process to potential engineers. They are tools that show 
how to define processes, how to use a defined process, how to plan, measure and track work time we spent on some issues, 
and how to measure and manage quality.  Some people need more time to finish their work because of errors checking but by 
practising this can lead to massive improvment.
